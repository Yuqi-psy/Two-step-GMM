The scripts of simulation studies and real data example for this paper were conducted with LatentGOLD 6.0 and R version 4.4.1, on a Windows operating system.

## Part 1: The content and organization of the documentation

The documentation for this paper is stored in a set of folders and subfolders, organized as outlined below:

**Scripts/**(the main script folder)

File in the top level of **Scripts/**

-   *README.Rmd* This document.

**CHARLS_realdata/** (sub-folder of **Scripts/**: contains the models syntax and R scripts for processing and analysing CHARLS data)

-   **LatentGOLD/** (sub-folder of **CHARLS_realdata/**: contain the LatentGOLD syntax files for different models)

*Classenum_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepA_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepB_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepC_CHARLS.brew*,...**Step3A_CHARLS.brew**

*NOTE:* These 12 files will be used for assigning labels and generating the corresponding `.lgs` file when the **CHARLS_Analysis.R** scripts are executed.

-   **R/** (sub-folder of **CHARLS_realdata/**: contain the R code for calling LatentGOLD to run the analysis)

**CHARLS_Process.R**: CHARLS raw data cleaning and processing scripts.

**CHARLS_Analysis.R**: CHARLS_cog data analysis scripts. When the scripts are executed, the `.brew` files will be written and generate the corresponding `.lgs` file for running the model in LatentGOLD, and the results files will be written by LatentGOLD.

**run.template.R**: Function scripts for calling LatentGOLD.


**Study_1/** (sub-folder of **Scripts/**: contains the models syntax and R scripts for conducting simulation study 1)


-   **LatentGOLD/** (sub-folder of **Study_1/**: contains the LatentGOLD syntax files for different models at different time points conditions)

**3_time_points/** (sub_folder of **LatentGOLD/**: contains the LatentGOLD syntax at 3 time points conditions in study 1)

**datasimcont3.csv**: Data file specify the starting values of population model I at 3 time points conditions.

**DatGen_3T.brew**: Brew file contains the LatentGOLD syntex for simulation dataset from population model I at three time points conditions. 

**onestep_3T.brew**, **step1_3T.brew**, **step2_3T.brew**, **step3_3T.brew**

*NOTE:* These `.brew` files will be written for assigning parameters and generating the corresponding `.lgs` file when the **Sim_study1.R** scripts are executed.
