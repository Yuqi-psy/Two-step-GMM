The scripts of simulation studies and real data example for this paper were conducted with LatentGOLD 6.0 and R version 4.4.1, on a Windows operating system.

## Part 1: The content and organization of the documentation

The documentation for this paper is stored in a set of folders and subfolders, organized as outlined below:

**Scripts/**(the main script folder)

File in the top level of **Scripts/**

-   *README.Rmd* This document.

**CHARLS_realdata/** (sub-folder of **Scripts/**: contain the models syntax and R code for processing and analysing CHARLS data)

-   **LatentGOLD/** (sub-folder of **CHARLS_realdata/**: contain the LatentGOLD syntax files for different models)

*Classenum_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepA_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepB_CHARLS.brew*, *OnestepC_CHARLS.brew*...


*NOTE:* These 12 files will be used for assigning labels and generating the corresponding `.lgs` file when the **CHARLS_Analysis.R** scripts are executed. 

-   **R/** (sub-folder of **CHARLS_realdata/**: contain the R code for assigning ladels, generating `.lgs` files and calling LatentGOLD to run the models )

**CHARLS_Process.R**: Raw CHARLS data cleaning and processing file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
